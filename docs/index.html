      <strong>Important:</strong> Purrsuit is designed as an offline-first app. All your data stays
      on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Purrsuit is an offline-first mobile app for tracking and managing pet encounters. Your privacy
      is our priority - we never collect, store, or transmit your personal data to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Photos and Pet Encounter Data</h3>
    <p>
      We store the following information locally on your device when you choose to create pet
      encounters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Photos you capture (original and thumbnail versions stored locally)</li>
      <li>Pet type (cat, dog, or other)</li>
      <li>Mood tags, custom tags, and stickers you've added</li>
      <li>Weather conditions and time of day (optional)</li>
      <li>Optional notes you've written</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Location Data (Optional)</h3>
    <p>Location data collection is entirely optional and under your control:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can add GPS coordinates by granting location permission and choosing "Use Current
        Location"
      </li>
      <li>You can add manual location labels (custom text descriptions)</li>
      <li>You can skip location entirely for any encounter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Location data, when provided, is stored locally on your device only.</p>

    <h3>2.3 No Automatic Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      We do not automatically collect any device information, usage statistics, or other data about
      your device or app behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is used solely within the app to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display your pet encounters with photos and information</li>
      <li>Show encounter details, tags, and metadata you've added</li>
      <li>Provide offline mapping when location data is included</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      All your data is stored locally on your device using encrypted storage (MMKV). Your photos,
      encounter information, and any location data never leave your device. We do not use cloud
      storage, external databases, or any form of data transmission.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Expo Platform Services</h3>
    <p>
      The app uses Expo's native modules for device functionality. These services operate locally on
      your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera access</strong> for photo capture (only when you choose to take photos)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location services</strong> for GPS coordinates (only when you choose to add
        location)
      </li>
      <li><strong>File system access</strong> for storing photos locally on your device</li>
      <li><strong>Image processing</strong> for photo editing and thumbnail generation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Map Services</h3>
    <p>
      For offline-capable mapping, we use MapLibre with OpenFreeMap tiles. Map tiles are downloaded
      locally to your device for offline use. Your location data is never transmitted to mapping
      service providers.
    </p>

    <h3>5.3 Error Reporting</h3>
    <p>
      We use Sentry for crash reporting in production builds only. Error reports may include
      technical information about app crashes but do not include your personal data, photos, or
      encounter information. Reports are sent only when your device is online and only for debugging
      purposes to improve app stability.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>View your data</strong>: Access all stored encounters and photos within the app
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delete encounters</strong>: Remove individual encounters by long-pressing them in
        the app
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Control permissions</strong>: Grant or deny camera/location access at any time
        through device settings
      </li>
      <li><strong>Delete all data</strong>: Uninstall the app to remove all stored data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Transmission</h2>
    <p>
      Purrsuit operates completely offline. No user data, photos, encounter information, or location
      data is transmitted to external servers. The app only downloads map tiles (stored locally) and
      may send anonymous error reports for debugging purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This app is designed for pet owners of all ages. We recommend parental guidance for users
      under 13. The app does not collect any personal information that would identify individual
      users.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
      posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete encounters or uninstall the app.
      We do not retain any data on external servers.
